An old project when learning python in 2017

This was my first project to learn python back in 2017. I don't think it even works properly anymore because I could not get python2 pip to install the hashlib library and python3 pip didn't even recognize it. I am sure there are many more problems as well, but I'll keep this here for historical reasons.
